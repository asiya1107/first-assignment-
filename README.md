# first-assignment-

Reflexting as I am going along, so not really reflecting more documenting.
This fixed but moving nav bar will be the end of me.
I had to get some help trying to get the text on the header and nav bar to stay fixed and also be ontop of the images whilst scrolling.

I was having trouble with getting the nav bar to do what i wanted it to but managed to sort that out. I thought this assignment would take ages to do but it was surprisingly quick however it was not quick and easy just quicker than i thought it would be

I think I have acheived all the requirments I added a prompt as a stretch goal so i hope i have met the required goals before adding extras without doing what was asked

overall i found the nav bar to be the most difficult now i just need to figure out how to submit
